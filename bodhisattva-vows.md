## Bodhisattva vows
May I be a protector to those without protection,<br>
A leader for those who journey,<br>
And a boat, a bridge, a passage<br>
For those desiring the further shore.<br>
May the pain of every living creature<br>
Be completely cleared away.<br>
May I be the doctor and the medicine<br>
And may I be the nurse<br>
For all sick beings in the world<br>
Until everyone is healed.<br>

Beings are numberless, I vow to save them<br>
Desires are inexhaustible, I vow to end them<br>
Dharma gates are boundless, I vow to enter them<br>
Buddha's way is unsurpassable, I vow to become it.<br>
