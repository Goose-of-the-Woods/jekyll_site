simply sharing, storytelling,  
documenting the whimsies, the land and places we find ourselves in;
slowly-building worlds - planting seeds and pixels, one at a time.
in a way, *goose of the woods* is a home we carry with and within us. 
we hope this can be a wholesome dwelling for all who pass through
